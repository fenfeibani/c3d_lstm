# Conv3D_CLSTM

## Prerequisites

1) Tensorflow-0.11 <br/>
2) Tensorlayer (commit ba30379f1b86f930d6e86e1c8db49cbd2d9aa314) <br/> 
   git clone https://github.com/zsdonghao/tensorlayer.git <br/>
   git checkout ba30379f1b86f930d6e86e1c8db49cbd2d9aa314 <br/>
   #### The original Tensorlayer does not support the convolutional LSTM, so the class RNNLayer in the tensorlayer/layers.py needs to be modified according to the tensorlayer-rnnlayer.py. <br/>
   
## Get the trained models
The trained models used in the paper can be obtained on the link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1o8kDT9K Password: efm2. <br/>

## How to use the code
Use training_*.py to train the networks. Please replace the paths in the codes with your paths first. <br/>
Use testing_*.py to validate the networks. Please replace the paths in the codes with your paths first. <br/>
